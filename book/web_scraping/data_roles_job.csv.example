Air Quality Science Co-Investigator,https://id.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=6fa0cda22184cf6d&from=serp&vjs=3,World Resources Institute,,,Jakarta,,,"Program Overview Clean Air Catalyst (CAC) is a new flagship program launched by The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and a global consortium of organizations, led by World Resources Institute (WRI) to accelerate clean air solutions in low and middle income countries. Clean Air Catalyst will work with communities around the world to identify and raise awareness of local pollution sources, and build focused coalitions to deliver interventions that lead to sustained progress on cleaner, healthier air. Through this new program, USAID will build capacity for tailored solutions that cut air pollution and improve human health in cities in developing countries. The primary sources of air pollution vary from city to city, but most cities in the developing world lack information on primary and secondary drivers of air pollution. Communities must first have a clear understanding of the main drivers of pollution in their region in order to develop effective pollution mitigation policies and strategies. Clean Air Catalyst seeks to change this dynamic by making the causes of pollution more visible and personal by building a vivid, shared understanding of the pathway to clean air. Our scientists and epidemiologists work with local scientists, business and government leaders to resolve key uncertainties about what is causing air pollution. We engage with communities to build trust in the results and raise awareness of what effective clean air action looks like. We delve into the root causes of these emissions to develop creative ways to manage pollution. We convene and support local coalitions – working with policy, business and community collaborators – to initiate and sustain these interventions.

Key Responsibilities: Collaborate closely with CAC partners (Jakarta-based staff, global experts, local partners/communities and researchers) in the development of pilot design and high-quality research.
