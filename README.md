# Bitlabs Webinar 2021

We use Python 3.8.11.

## Getting Started

To run the jupyter-book locally, first install all packages in the `requirements.txt`. 
Then, run `jb build book` in your terminal. You will find the rendered html files inside `book/_build/html/`, 
just open the `index.html` on your browser. You have your local jupyter-book!

## GitHub Pages

If you care only on HTML files, please go to branch `book`.
